/*initial speed
 m = mass of disc
 r = radius of shooter
 w = rotational speed of shooter
 v = speed of disc
 h = diff btn shooter height and release point
1/2 r^2 * omega^2 * m - mgh = 1/2 m * v ^2
v0 max = sqrt(r^2 * w^2 - 2gh)
need to include friction loss, air resistance beuracy through the air*/
